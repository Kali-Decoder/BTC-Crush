🚀 BTC Crush: Vault-Adventure GameFi
Concept Overview:
BTC Crush is a gamified DeFi protocol where users lock BTC (or BTC-backed assets like wBTC or fBTC) into various "Vault Levels" to earn yield, collect NFTs, and progress through stages. Each level is designed with unique mechanics, lock durations, APRs, and reward systems, turning traditional vaults into an engaging, interactive GameFi experience.

🔁 User Flow Finalized ✅
 End-to-end flow for users is ready, from connecting wallets to interacting with the vault.


1. Vault Levels (Game Stages)
Each level represents a vault with:


Different APRs based on lock periods (e.g., 7 days, 30 days, 90 days).


Access tiers depending on the BTC amount locked (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold).


Dynamic rewards (NFTs, yield boosts, game tokens).


Difficulty mechanics: For example, longer locks = higher risk/reward.


2. Gamification Layers
Users "crush" through levels by completing challenges (locking BTC for specific terms).


Progression unlocks:


Achievements


Mystery NFT loot boxes


Leaderboards


Each level can simulate a "boss" vault or "puzzle" that needs strategic decision-making.


3. NFT Integration
NFTs represent user status, vault tier, or power-ups (e.g., APR boosters).


Rarity increases with higher lock amounts or longer durations.


NFTs can be:


Tradable on secondary markets


Staked for bonus rewards


Combined or evolved through gameplay (merge feature)


4. Reward System
Base rewards: BTC yield/APR depending on level.


Bonus rewards: Random NFT drops, multiplier tokens.


Streak bonuses: Continuous participation unlocks time-based perks.
